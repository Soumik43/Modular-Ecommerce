# Modular E-commerce [ Communication between modular components ]

E-commerce website are a very commonplace site now a days.
Here we created a simple page for a product listing page. The data for the product cards can come from either a static json file or hosted on GitHub as static json file. 
It is preferable to a static json file hosted on GitHub.
Once the product components are loaded on the page, each component will have a counter that lists the number of products selected by the user.
There will be a Cart component can be placed on the page. 
This component should store the following information.
  - Number of products
  - Total amount of the order.
  - Optionally items placed in the cart (see sample image) ( this can be avoided if you still are learning HTML/CSS )
